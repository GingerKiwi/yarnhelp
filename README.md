The Yarn Gift Helper is designed to help non-knitters know how much yarn to gift the knitters in their life.

## Knitting is...

"Knitting is at its fundamentals, a binary code featuring top-down design, standardized submodules, and recursive logic that relies on ratios, mathematical principles, and an intuitive grasp of three-dimensional geometry." ~ Kim Salazar KnitList 1995"

## The Developer as a Knitter:

I've been knitting since I was six years old, and typically have one sweater on the go plus smaller sock, mitten, hat or other projects. I greatly enjoy multi-colour stranded knitting ("Fairisle") and cables. I firmly believe that anyone can learn to knit - but not everyone has to learn.
