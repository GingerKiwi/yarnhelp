          <p class="emphasis">March 25, 2023: Calculations have been added for crochet sweaters and both knit and crochet scarfs - including a Doctor Who scarf on the <a href="/howmuchyarn.html">How Much Yarn page</a>. <p class="margin-bottom-2rem">The site is a bit buggy, but publishing because there's a need for crochet calculations. <span class="emphasis">Please reload if things don't work after you type in a number and press/tap calculate.</span> Issue should be fixed this week.</p>
            <p >March 17, 2023: <span class="emphasis">This site is currently only optimized for mobile devices. It works, but the layout is off on laptops and larger screens.</span> I've chosen to deploy the current development branch because the design is much nicer than the old one.</p>

      <h1>Yarn Help!</h1>
      <div>
        
          Welcome to YarnHelp.app. This is a site for knitters and crocheters of
          all levels who want yarn math help, as well as their friends and
          family that just want to know
          <a href="howmuchyarn.html">"how much yarn"</a> to give them as a gift. Right now (March, 2023) the focus is on that page. Later on, you'll find yarn math help and tools for:
          <ul>
            <li>Calculating gauge</li>
            <li>How many stitches to cast on for sweaters, socks, hats, and other projects</li>
            <li>Weight equivlents for holding yarn double</li>
            <li>Needle and hook size convertors</li>
            <li>French language versions of some of the pages</li>
        </p>

        <h2>Version 2.0 March 2023</h2>
        <p>
          The idea for this site started in March 2022, and was first published
          as a one page website with a really basic design in September, 2022.
          Currently, as of March 2023, development is focusing on a mobile
          friendly version of the
          <a href="howmuchyarn.html">"How Much Yarn page"</a> followed by
          a responsive design of the entire site for larger screen sizes. I'll also be
          collaborating with a friend who's a senior dev to create a progressive
          web app version (pwa) of The Yarn Gift Helper page so people can
          install it on their phones and use it offline. (Some yarn shops have
          basements with spotty cell reception!)
