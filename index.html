          Welcome to YarnHelp.app. This is a site for knitters and crocheters of
          all levels who want yarn math help, as well as their friends and
          family that just want to know
          <a href="howmuchyarn.html">"how much yarn"</a> to give them as a gift. Right now (March, 2023) the focus is on that page. Later on, you'll find yarn math help and tools for:
          <ul>
            <li>Calculating gauge</li>
            <li>How many stitches to cast on for sweaters, socks, hats, and other projects</li>
            <li>Weight equivlents for holding yarn double</li>
            <li>Needle and hook size convertors</li>
            <li>French language versions of some of the pages</li>
          </ul>
        <span class="emphasis">Note: This site is currently only optimized for mobile devices. It works, but the layout is off on laptops and larger screens. I'm focusing on the functionality first because there's been requests for the Yarn Gift Calculator.</span>

      <p class="padding-bottom-2rem"><span class="emphasis">March 25, 2023: </span> Calculations have been added for cat mats and baby blankets in the blankets section. Bugs from March 26th are fixed. A <a href="/doctorwho.html">Doctor Who Scarf page</a> has been added with number of balls calculator for a season 12 size scarf. Future will have a Doctor Who Scarf pattern generator for season 12. 
      </p>
      <p class="padding-bottom-2rem"> <span class="emphasis">March 25, 2023: </span>Calculations have been added for crochet sweaters and both knit and crochet scarfs - including a Doctor Who scarf on the <a href="/howmuchyarn.html">How Much Yarn page</a>. </p>
        <p>March 17, 2023: <span class="emphasis">This site is currently only optimized for mobile devices. It works, but the layout is off on laptops and larger screens.</span> I've chosen to deploy the current development branch because the design is much nicer than the old one.</p>

      <h2>Version 2.1 March 27, 2023</h2>
      <p class="padding-bottom-2rem">This updated version includes a page for a <a href="/doctorwho.html">Doctor Who Scarf</a> and calculations for how many balls to make scarfs, plus cat mats and baby blankets in <a href="/howmuchyarn.html">The Yarn Gift Calculator</a> What is published is what has been completed up to March 27, 2023 around 3pm EST.</p>
        <h2>Version 2.0 March 17 2023</h2>
        <p>
          The idea for this site started in March 2022, and was first published
          as a one page website with a really basic design in September, 2022.
          Currently, as of March 2023, development is focusing on a mobile
          friendly version of the
          <a href="howmuchyarn.html">"How Much Yarn page"</a> followed by
          a responsive design of the entire site for larger screen sizes. I'll also be
          collaborating with a friend who's a senior dev to create a progressive
          web app version (pwa) of The Yarn Gift Helper page so people can
          install it on their phones and use it offline. (Some yarn shops have
          basements with spotty cell reception!)
