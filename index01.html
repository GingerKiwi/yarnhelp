                Are you a non-knitter who would like to gift yarn to a knitter
                in your life, but have no idea how much to get?
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              With over 240,000 different yarns in the world*, many different
              thicknesses ("weights"), and yarn brands having different lengths
              of yarn in each ball/skein, it definately can be confusing.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Yarn Gift Helper is designed to help non-knitters quickly
              figure out how much yarn to buy for their family members and
              friends who are knitters - without spending hours learning about
              yarn. This current edition is just for pullover sweaters/jumpers
              made with medium thickness yarn. Over the next year, it will be
              expanded to include different weights (thickness) of yarn and
              different types of project (eg mitten and hat sets).

          <h3>About the Developer</h3>
          <p>
            This web app has been developed by Elizabeth McCready. I've been
            knitting since I was six years old and often get people asking me
            advice on what gifts to get the knitters in their life. I'm
            switching careers into web development after a career in special
            education.

          <h3>About this App</h3>

          <p>
            VERSION 1.0: This current initial release (1.0) of the Yarn Gift
            Helper has been quickly adapted in an afternoon from a
            <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend?topic=react"
              >Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path</a
            >
            solo project (unit convertor). The inital idea for The Yarn Gift
            Helper was
            <a href="https://codepen.io/bradtraversy/pen/jGNWey?editors=0010"
              >this codepen by Brad Travesy that I coded along with and
              refactored with Bootstrap 5</a
            >
            in early 2022.
          </p>
          <p>
            VERSION 2.0: Accessibility and being able to view on a variety of
            device sizes are both important. The 2.0 release of The Yarn Gift
            Helper will be a redesign that includes a responsive layout,
            accessible first design, and most likely a d4rk/light theme
            switcher.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Yarn Gift Helper app will eventually connect to the Ravelry.com
            yarn database ("api") of 240,475 yarns so users can search by yarn
            name and have the yardage automatically inputted for them.
